# Module Layout

OpenCore uses feature-oriented packages inside the `:app` Gradle module. Packages are intentionally shaped like modules so they can be promoted to Gradle library modules later without rewriting feature boundaries.

Onboarding flow state is owned by `OnboardingComponent` and mutated through explicit intents — not a global store.

SidePanel is a self-contained internal module combining two scopes (session + setting) with feature-owned infrastructure in `infrastructure/`. Its `application/` package nests `session/` and `setting/` sub-packages, each with its own component, state, intent, and reducer.

Home uses flat role folders only (`application/`, `models/`, `utilities/`, `infrastructure/`, `presenter/`, `theme/`). Context window and speed mode types live alongside other Home models and utilities.

`ChatView` is the Chat module entry view for the active message thread. The composer chatbox (`HomeComposerView`) stays owned and positioned by Home in both welcome and chat states.

## Role-based folders

Each feature organizes files by responsibility:

- `domain/` — domain types and value objects
- `application/` — Decompose components, intents, reducers, state
- `infrastructure/` — persistence clients, HTTP adapters, codecs
- `presenter/` — Compose screens and visual components
- `utilities/` — helpers that are not domain or infrastructure
- `theme/` — feature-scoped tokens and typography

Folder names describe product roles, not design-pattern names.

## Internal module boundaries

All feature packages live in `:app`. Types default to `internal`. Each module exposes a **Facade** (`OnboardingFacade`, `HomeFacade`, `ChatFacade`, `SidePanelFacade`) plus one or two shell entry composables for `MainActivity` wiring. Cross-feature calls go through facades and injected components — not direct presenter imports.

Promote to a Gradle library module only when a boundary needs stronger isolation than package visibility.
